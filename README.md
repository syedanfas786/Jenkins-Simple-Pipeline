This **Jenkins pipeline** automates the entire CI/CD process, ensuring seamless integration, testing, security checks, and deployment. Here's a concise breakdown:

### Stages:

1. **Build**:
   - Builds the application and confirms the use of Maven as the build tool.

2. **Unit and Integration Tests**:
   - Executes unit and integration tests. Sends email notifications for both success and failure, with logs attached.

3. **Code Analysis**:
   - Runs code analysis using SonarQube and logs the process.

4. **Security Scan**:
   - Performs a security scan with OWASP Dependency-Check. Notifies the result via email, including logs.

5. **Deploy to Staging**:
   - Deploys the application to the staging environment using AWS CodeDeploy.

6. **Integration Tests on Staging**:
   - Conducts integration tests on the staging environment with JMeter, sending emails based on the test results.

7. **Deploy to Production**:
   - Deploys the application to production using AWS CodeDeploy.

### Notification System:
Email notifications are sent at critical points (test results, security scans) to `syedanfas786@gmail.com`, ensuring visibility of success or failure, with logs attached for troubleshooting.

This pipeline ensures a robust CI/CD process from build to production, incorporating quality assurance and security checks at each stage.
